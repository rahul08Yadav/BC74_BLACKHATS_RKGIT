# How our app resolves issues of existing safety apps?

## -> Tracking using gps or last location

we provide the user 6 digit code after registration to create a group this code can be shared by the falmily members so that all the members of the family can join a group and get linked with each other and each member can access the location of the other person. It will show their live location if the anyone is sharing 
their live location orelse it will show their last lacation.

## -> No issues while login.

## -> Only important notifications shown.
 
## -> Accurate longitude and latitude of location sent to people added in the group


## ->Functions in background-shares the location until the SOS button is pressed again to stop location share.

There is no difficulty sharing the location, with just a click the person can share his location and can even close the app and the app will keep sharing the location in the background with a notification shown in navigation and would stop sharing the location if button pressed again.
